# meshviewer

The meshviewer presents the frontend map which reads the meshviewer.json and nodes.json which is created by a respondd node info collector (like yanic).

The meshviewer allows to have a geo overlay to show the segments/domains of your freifunk site.

Furthermore, it allows to show a hint for old devices which are deprecated, by setting a `deprecation_text`
